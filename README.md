# NAME

DBIx::Class::Helper::TableSample - Add support for tablesample clauses

# VERSION

version v0.4.1

# SYNOPSIS

In a resultset:

```perl
package MyApp::Schema::ResultSet::Wobbles;

use base qw/DBIx::Class::ResultSet/;

__PACKAGE__->load_components( qw/
    Helper::TableSample
/);
```

Using the resultset:

```perl
my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
  undef,
  {
    columns     => [qw/ id name /],
    tablesample => {
      method   => 'system',
      fraction => 0.5,
    },
  }
);
```

This generates the SQL

```
SELECT me.id, me.name FROM table me TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (0.5)
```

# DESCRIPTION

This helper adds rudimentary support for tablesample queries
to [DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx%3A%3AClass) resultsets.

The `tablesample` key supports the following options as a hash
reference:

- `fraction`

    This is the percentage or fraction of the table to sample,
    between 0 and 100, or a numeric expression that returns
    such a value.

    (Some databases may restrict this to an integer.)

    The value is not checked by this helper, so you can use
    database-specific extensions, e.g. `1000 ROWS` or `15 PERCENT`.

    Scalar references are dereferenced, and expressions or
    database-specific extensions should be specified has scalar
    references, e.g.

    ```perl
    my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
      undef,
      {
        columns     => [qw/ id name /],
        tablesample => {
          fraction => \ "1000 ROWS",
        },
      }
    );
    ```

- `method`

    By default, there is no sampling method, e.g. you can simply use:

    ```perl
    my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
      undef,
      {
        columns     => [qw/ id name /],
        tablesample => 5,
      }
    );
    ```

    as an equivalent of

    ```perl
    my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
      undef,
      {
        columns     => [qw/ id name /],
        tablesample => { fraction => 5 },
      }
    );
    ```

    to generate

    ```
    SELECT me.id FROM table me TABLESAMPLE (5)
    ```

    If your database supports or requires a sampling method, you can
    specify it, e.g. `system` or `bernoulli`.

    ```perl
    my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
      undef,
      {
        columns     => [qw/ id name /],
        tablesample => {
           fraction => 5,
           method   => 'system',
        },
      }
    );
    ```

    will generate

    ```
    SELECT me.id FROM table me TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (5)
    ```

    See your database documentation for the allowable methods.  Note that some databases require it.

    Prior to version 0.3.0, this was called `type`. It is supported for
    backwards compatability.

- `repeatable`

    If this key is specified, then it will add a REPEATABLE clause,
    e.g.

    ```perl
    my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
      undef,
      {
        columns     => [qw/ id name /],
        tablesample => {
          fraction   => 5,
          repeatable => 123456,
        },
      }
    );
    ```

    to generate

    ```
    SELECT me.id FROM table me TABLESAMPLE (5) REPEATABLE (123456)
    ```

    Scalar references are dereferenced, and expressions or
    database-specific extensions should be specified has scalar
    references.

# KNOWN ISSUES

Resultsets with joins or inner queries are not supported.

Delete and update queries are not supported.

Oracle has a non-standard table sampling syntax, so is not yet supported.

Not all databases support table sampling, and those that do may have
different restrictions.  You should consult your database
documentation.

# SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.4.0, the this module requires Perl v5.14 or later.

Future releases may only support Perl versions released in the last ten years.

If you need this module on Perl v5.10, please use one of the v0.3.x
versions of this module.  Significant bug or security fixes may be
backported to those versions.
